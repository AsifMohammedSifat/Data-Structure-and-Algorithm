Single Source Shortest Path(SSSP)
=================================

BFS:
    Possible:
                  UnWeighted 
                  Undirected + Directed
                  Non-Negative Node + Non-negative edge weight
    ImPossible:
                  Weighted
                  Negative Node + Negative edge weight
                  
                  Solution:
                  Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford algorithm it can be possible
DFS:
    Not-Possible to determine Single Source Shortest Path
