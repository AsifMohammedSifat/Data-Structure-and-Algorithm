1) What is Binary Search Tree
Ans: 
    A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure used for organizing and managing a collection of elements in a way that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is called a "binary" search tree because each node in the tree has at most two child nodes, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child.

    The key characteristic of a binary search tree is that it maintains the following property:

    -> The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    -> The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

    Operations:
              -> Insert, Delete, Search

2) BST Insertion Theory + Complexity + Implementation
   Insert + Delete + Search :O(height) Random Order insertion O(logn)
                                       Sorted Order insertion - O(n)
